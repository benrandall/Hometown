List of features:
When you open the app for the first time, you will need to create an account, which will take you to a navigation screen. If you click cities on that screen, you will be taken to a list of Texas cities and it will notify you which city you are closest to, if you click a city it will pick a random artist from the city to highlight, you can continually generate random albums from that city with a button on that screen. If you like the album, you can save it and it will add it to your favorites list which you can access by backing back to the navigating screen and clicking favorites. If you click an album on the favorites page the album’s info will appear.
